# PostmarkUI
A React/Redux Material-UI Themed Frontend for Postmark

## Project: 

A small Node.js program to convert Postman collections to Markdown friendly syntax. PostMark takes a collection of API routes from Postman and converts it into Markdown friendly syntax ready to be added to a GitHub README.md file. For our first stage we are using GitHub Flavored Markdown, hopefully adding others if time permits.
Since documentation is incredibly important when hosting a project on GitHub we believe that this will help developers very easily show the routes used in their APIs. This should save the developer time, make using a project easier for users and improve readability of documentation.
We hope to make PostMark an installable NodeJS package and eventually a serverless function that any user can pass a JSON-based Postman collection to and receive back Markdown syntax.

### Sandbox: 
Creating a UI for the PostMark npm, bringing in the functionality of this node package where a user can simply input a Postman collection, click a button to render the formatted data to append to or generate docs.
